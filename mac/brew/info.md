The error you’re encountering typically indicates a problem with the `launchctl` command, such as permission issues, a misconfigured `plist` file, or a problem with the `nginx` setup. Let's troubleshoot and resolve it.

---

### Steps to Fix

#### 1. **Check Nginx Installation**
Ensure Nginx is installed and correctly set up using Homebrew. Run:
```bash
brew services list
```
This will show the status of `nginx`. If it’s not installed, install it:
```bash
brew install nginx
```

#### 2. **Verify the `plist` File**
The `.plist` file is used by `launchctl` to manage the service. Check the contents of `/Users/pandi-rofai/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist`. Ensure it is correctly configured. A typical Nginx `plist` might look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>homebrew.mxcl.nginx</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/nginx</string>
        <string>-g</string>
        <string>daemon off;</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/usr/local/var/www</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/usr/local/var/log/nginx/error.log</string>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/usr/local/var/log/nginx/access.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Check for typos or incorrect paths. 

#### 3. **Fix Ownership and Permissions**
Ensure the file has the correct permissions:
```bash
sudo chown $(whoami):staff /Users/pandi-rofai/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist
chmod 644 /Users/pandi-rofai/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist
```

#### 4. **Run with Elevated Permissions**
Try running the `launchctl` commands as `sudo` for better error diagnostics:
```bash
sudo /bin/launchctl enable gui/502/homebrew.mxcl.nginx
sudo /bin/launchctl bootstrap gui/502 /Users/pandi-rofai/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist
```

#### 5. **Check Logs for More Information**
If the error persists, check the system logs for more details:
```bash
log show --predicate 'process == "nginx"' --info --last 1h
```
or Nginx-specific logs:
```bash
tail -f /usr/local/var/log/nginx/error.log
```

#### 6. **Start Nginx Manually**
To verify if the issue is with `launchctl` or the Nginx setup, try starting Nginx manually:
```bash
nginx
```
If it starts successfully, the problem lies with the `plist` or `launchctl` configuration.

#### 7. **Reset Launch Services**
If none of the above works, reset your launch services for Nginx:
```bash
launchctl remove homebrew.mxcl.nginx
brew services restart nginx
```

### Common Fixes
- Ensure you’re using the correct user ID (`gui/502`) in `launchctl`. Use `id -u` to confirm your user ID.
- If you’re on macOS Ventura or later, the sandboxing model might require adjustments in `nginx.conf`, especially for file paths.
