# Active MQ artemis

## STOMP
```
STOMP is a text-orientated wire protocol that allows STOMP clients to communicate with STOMP Brokers. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports STOMP 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.

STOMP clients are available for several languages and platforms making it a good choice for interoperability.

By default there are acceptor elements configured to accept STOMP connections on ports 61616 and 61613.

See the general Protocols and Interoperability chapter for details on configuring an acceptor for STOMP.

Refer to the STOMP examples for a look at some of this functionality in action.

## AMQP 
```
Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports the AMQP 1.0 specification. By default there are acceptor elements configured to accept AMQP connections on ports 61616 and 5672.

See the general Protocols and Interoperability chapter for details on configuring an acceptor for AMQP.
